# My goal is to make the game tic-tac-toe scalable - without using hard code - so that you can change the parameters
# by changing the playing field.
#
# At the same time, I have immutable rules that the user cannot change, such as the name "X" and "O", and also that
# the number of cells is equal in width and height.
#
# It is also ideal to write the code typed so that it is easy to read and understand.
